Output/Results:
Model Performance-
The YOLOv8 detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 93.5% on the held-out test set of tomato leaf images, surpassing our initial target of 90%.
Battery Life: Memory Usage: The optimized YOLOv8 model required 245MB of GPU memory during inference, making it deployable on edge devices with limited resources.
Model Convergence: The fine-tuned model reached optimal performance after 75 epochs of training, with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 16.

Key Insights:
Healthy plants were the most reliably identified, with near-perfect precision and recall.
Early and Late Blight were detected with the highest confidence and consistency, likely due to their well-defined visual patterns.
Leaf Mold and Black Spot showed the lowest recall, suggesting either visual similarity to other classes or underrepresentation in the dataset.
The model maintains real-time capability, processing each image in ~23ms.
With an overall mAP50-95 of 51.0%, the model shows solid generalization across diverse leaf disease patterns.
